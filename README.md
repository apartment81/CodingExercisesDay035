1. Array sorting usinng Bubble sort.
>Bubble sort is a simple algorithm which compares the first element of the array to the next one. If the current element of the array is numerically greater than the next one, the elements are swapped.
2. Array sorting using Insertion algorithm.
>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm suited for small data sets. During each iteration, the algorithm:
-Removes an element from an array
-Compares it against the largest value in the array
-Moves the element to its correct location.
